# Experimental Research Design

In my research design class at Columbia, we were given an assignment to write a research proposal to choose a management dilemma we wanted to address by conducting research analysis, collecting data, and choosing an analysis methodology. For the research, I chose to do an experimental study with a control and test group where only the test group would receive treatment. The study will be conducted on clinically depressed patients who will receive newly tested treatment pills to see if symptoms can be alleviated. The control group will receive a placebo pill while the test group will receive the real pills. After a six month trial, the sample will be surveyed on a Likert Scale from 1 - 5 to see if their frequency of mood swing has been lowered and if their overall mental state has been improved. 

Likert Scale:
  Frequency of mood swings:
  1 – not recently, 2 – once in the 3 months, 3 – once a month, 4 – once a week, 5 – almost every day 
  
  Overall mental state has improved throughout the study:
  1 – strongly disagree, 2 – disagree, 3 – neutral, 4 – agree, 5 – strongly agree
  
 See R code for data generated for control and test group that will use below analysis methodology.

# Analysis Methodology chosen
As the experimental design consists of two independent sample groups – a controlled and experimental group, I will use a parametric test, an unpaired two-samples t-test to compare the means of two independent group’s Likert scale. 

See R code for t test conducted.
